# gravity
My Godot 4.5 project where I am going to try and make a realistic-ish space/gravity sim. Close to what Outer Wilds has(go play it).

This means very little natural deceleration, and proper-ish gravity. The gravity will hopefully have custom falloff distance and custom max gravity and distance.
